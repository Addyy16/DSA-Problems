// ## Question :-

// The "Nambiar Number" Generator: M.Nambiar has devised a mechanism to process any given mobile number and thus generate a new resultant number. 
// He calls this mechanism as the "Nambiar Number Generator" and the resultant number is referred to as the "Nambiar Number". 
// The mechanism is as follows :-
// "In the given mobile number, starting with the first digit, keep on adding all subsequent digits till the state (even or odd) of the sum of the digits is opposite to the state (odd or even) of the first digit. 
// Continue this from the subsequent digit till the last digit of the mobile number is reached. Concatenating the sums thus generated results in the Nambiar Number."

// The below examples will help to illustrate this.

// Please also look at the bottom of this problem description for the expected function prototype.

// Example 1 :

// If the given mobile number is 9880127431

// The first pass should start with the first digit.

// First digit is 9 which is odd.

// So, we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes even.
//  9+8=17 (17 is odd, so continue adding the digits) 
//  9+8+8 = 25 (25 is odd, so continue adding the digits) 
//  9+8+8+0 = 25 (25 is odd, so continue adding the digits) 
//  9+8+8+0+1=26 (26 is even, which is opposite to the state of the first digit 9) 
//  So, Stop first pass here and remember that the result at the end of first pass = 26

// Now we enter the second pass.

// The second pass should start after the digit where we stopped the first pass. In the first pass we have added the digits 9,8,8,0 and 1.

// Now we enter the second pass.

// The second pass should start after the digit where we stopped the first pass.

// In the first pass we have added the digits 9,8,8,0 and 1.

// So, the first digit for second pass will be 2, which is even.

// Now, we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes odd.

// 2+7 = 9 (9 is odd, which is opposite to the state of the first digit 2)

// So, Stop second pass here and remember that the result at the end of second pass = 9

// Now we enter the third pass.

// In the first pass we have added the digits 9,8,8,0 and 1, and the resultant sum was 26.

// In the second pass we have added the digits 2 and 7, and the resultant sum was 9.

// The third pass should start after the digit where we stopped the second pass.

// So, the first digit for third pass will be 4, which is even.

// Now, we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes odd. 
// 4+3=7 (7 is odd, which is opposite to the state of the first digit 4)

// So, Stop third pass here and remember that the result at the end of third pass =7

// Now we enter the fourth pass.

// In the first pass we have added the digits 9,8,8,0 and 1, and the resultant sum was 26.

// In the second pass we have added the digits 2 and 7, and the resultant sum was 9.

// In the third pass we have added the digits 4 and 3, and the resultant sum was 7. 

// The fourth pass should start after the digit where we stopped the third pass.

// So, the first digit for fourth pass will be 1, which is odd.

// Now, we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes even.

// However, we realize that this digit 1 is the last digit of the mobile number and there are no further digits. So, Stop fourth pass here and remember that the result at the end of fourth pass =1

// For the mobile number 9880127431, the resultant number (Nambiar Number) will be the concatenation of the results of the 4 passes = [26][9][7][1] = 26971

// Note 1: Please note that the number of passes required to process the given number may vary depending upon the constitution of the mobile number.

// Note2: Also note that, 0 should be considered as an even number

// Example 2 :

// If the given mobile number is 9860857152

// First digit 9 is odd.

// First pass results in 9+8+6+0+8+5 = 36

// Second pass results in 7+1=8

// Third pass results in 5+2=7

// Note that the third pass stops at 7 (even though we do not meet a change of state) because we have reached the end of the mobile number.

// For the mobile number 9860857152, the resultant number (Nambiar Number) will be the concatenation of the results of the 3 passes = [36][8][7] = 3687

// Example 3

// If the given mobile number is 8123454210

// The resultant number (Nambiar Number) will be 95970

// Example 4

// If the given mobile number is 9900114279

// The resultant number (Nambiar Number) will be 181149
